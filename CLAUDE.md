# Horizon COMPASS — Claude Code Context

## What this app is
Single-file FHWA/NEPA public involvement (PI) compliance platform. All code lives in **`index.html`** (~13,600 lines). No build step. Deployed on **GitHub Pages** at `https://putzke.github.io/pi-registry/`. Backend is **Supabase** (REST API, no Supabase JS client).

Other files: `mobile.html` (mobile companion), `importer.html` (bulk data import), `seed-sample-data.js` (seed script run from browser console).

## Architecture

### Data layer
- `DB.get('table')` / `DB.getActive('table')` — reads from `_syncCache[k]`
- `DB.set('table', arr)` — writes cache and triggers `DB._sync()` to push to Supabase
- `_syncCache` is populated at startup via `loadAllData()`
- `SB_TABLES` (line ~657) maps internal names → Supabase table names
- `SB_TO_INT` (line ~678) maps Supabase column names → internal field names (used in `fromSB()`)
- `toSB(table, obj)` / `fromSB(table, row)` — serialization helpers
- `sbGet()`, `sbAdd()`, `sbUpdate()`, `sbDelete()` — Supabase REST helpers
- `DATE_FIELDS` Set — columns that must be `null` (not `''`) when empty
- `TEXT_PK_TABLES` — tables using app-generated text PKs (most use Supabase integer auto-increment)
- **Important**: `pi_projects` and `pi_stakeholders` use `GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY` integer PKs. Never pre-assign text IDs for these.

### State
```javascript
const S = {
  view: 'dashboard',       // current nav view
  projectFilter: null,     // active project ID (string)
  rptTab: 'reports',       // reports sub-tab: 'reports' | 'pi-editor' | 'archive'
  stakeTab: 'info',
  skView: 'list',
  // ... other UI state
};
```

### Supabase tables
```
pi_projects, pi_stakeholders, pi_project_stakeholders,
pi_interactions, pi_deliverables, pi_meetings,
pi_issues, pi_issue_interactions, pi_commitments,
pi_groups, pi_group_members, pi_dismissed_pairs,
pi_comment_periods, pi_public_comments,
pi_tribal_consultations,
pi_reports,         -- PI report drafts (one per project)
pi_report_archive   -- exported report snapshots (up to 50 per project)
```

### Navigation views
`dashboard | projects | master | stakeholders | interactions | followups | commitments | comments | tribal | deliverables | meetings | issues | map | reports | settings`

### Key functions (by line)
- `render()` — 1480: main dispatch
- `renderDash()` — 1501
- `renderMaster()` — 2994: stakeholder master list
- `renderStakeholders()` — 3127
- `renderInteractions()` — 4494
- `renderReports()` — 6652: Reports view with 3-tab layout (Quick Reports / PI Report Editor / Archive)
- `openPIReport()` — 8311: replaces main area with split-pane PI report editor
- `exportPIDocx()` — 8848: async, auto-archives then exports Word file
- `renderMeetings()` — 10308
- `renderTribal()` — 11827
- `renderComments()` — 12183
- `renderSettings()` — 13067

## Reports module (most recently worked on)

### Reports view tabs (S.rptTab)
- **`'reports'`** — summary stats bar, distribution group checkboxes, 10 report-type cards
- **`'pi-editor'`** — landing card with draft status + "Open editor" button (opens split-pane `openPIReport()`)
- **`'archive'`** — `_buildArchiveHTML()` output with AI trend button

### PI Report Editor (openPIReport)
- Replaces full `#main` div (including topbar)
- Left pane `#rpt-editor-pane` (50%): header inputs + section list with move/remove/AI draft
- Right pane `#rpt-preview-pane` (50%): live preview via `schedulePreview()` → `renderLivePreview()` (350ms debounce)
- All inputs wired to `oninput="schedulePreview()"`
- Use `fmt(d)` for date formatting (NOT `fmtDate` — that doesn't exist)

### Report persistence
- `loadReportSections(projF)` — Supabase-first (`_syncCache['reports']`), localStorage fallback
- `savePIReportDraft()` — async, saves to `pi_reports` (insert or update) + localStorage key `pir4_pi_reports_{projId}`
- `resetPIReportDraft()` — async, deletes from Supabase + localStorage

### Report archive
- `ARCHIVE_LIMIT = 50` per project
- `_archiveReport(projF)` — async, called inside `exportPIDocx()` before download
- `deleteArchivedReport(archiveId)` — async, re-renders `#rpt-archive-panel` in place
- `_buildArchiveHTML(projF)` — renders archive list + AI trend button (shown when 2+ archives)
- `generateTrendSummary()` — async, sends all archived report digests to Claude Haiku, renders trend narrative in `#trend-result`

### Claude AI integration
- API key stored obfuscated (XOR+base64) in localStorage key `compass_claude_api_key_v2`
- `_getClaudeKey()` / `_setClaudeKey(key)` — read/write helpers
- `_claudeNarrative(systemPrompt, userContent)` — shared fetch wrapper, model: `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, max_tokens: 400
- CSP `connect-src` includes `https://api.anthropic.com`
- Confirmation dialog required before bulk AI calls (cost estimate shown)

## Important conventions
- **No `fmtDate()`** — use `fmt(d)` (defined ~line 1311)
- **No build step** — edit `index.html` directly, syntax-check with:
  ```bash
  node -e "const fs=require('fs'),html=fs.readFileSync('index.html','utf8');const s=[];let m,r=/<script>([\s\S]*?)<\/script>/g;while((m=r.exec(html)))s.push(m[1]);try{new Function(s.join('\n'));console.log('OK');}catch(e){console.log('ERROR:',e.message);}"
  ```
- After every edit, run the syntax check before committing
- Push to `main` branch: `git push origin HEAD:main`
- Working branch also: `claude/pi-registry-scroll-fixes-c2i1cc`

## Mobile app (`mobile.html`)
Field companion for logging interactions, managing contacts, follow-ups, and issues. ~2,420 lines.
- **Status: current** — LEP, EJ (`underserved`), and `equityFormSubmitted` fields are all implemented
- Has its own `SB_TABLES`, `SB_TO_INT`, `toSB()`, `fromSB()`, `sbGet/Add/Update/Delete()`, `loadAllData()`
- Does NOT have the reports module — reports are desktop-only
- No known bugs as of this session

## Importer app (`importer.html`)
Bulk CSV import wizard for stakeholders and interactions. ~2,420 lines.
- **Updated this session**: added LEP and EJ/underserved field support:
  - `SB_TO_INT` pi_stakeholders: `lep` and `underserved` mappings added
  - `APP_FIELDS`: LEP and EJ appear in the column-mapping dropdown
  - `AUTO_MAP`: auto-detects headers `lep`, `limited english`, `underserved`, `ej`, `environmental justice`
  - Boolean parsing: `yes/true/1/y → true` for `lep`/`underserved` (same as `isMaster`)
- `sbAdd()` at line ~746 calls `r.json()` directly — safe because it uses plain POST (not upsert), so body is never empty

## Pending / next tasks
1. **Manual "Save to archive" button** — checkpoint a draft without exporting (discussed, not yet built)
2. **Absorb popup report windows** — currently `generateReport()`, `generatePISummary()`, `generateIssuesReport()` open `window.open()` popups; absorb into inline output panel (deferred by user)
3. **AI cross-report trend summary testing** — needs 2+ real exports to test fully
4. **NEPA checklist progress bar on project cards** — may be partially implemented, needs verification
5. **Continue testing** stakeholders LEP/EJ checkboxes, public meeting equity toggle, public comments nav/form
6. **NEPA Compliance section in PI Report Editor** — new section type `'nepa-compliance'` in the Add Section dropdown; auto-populates with live checklist group progress + comment period compliance for the project; includes an "AI Draft" button that calls `_claudeNarrative()` to generate a professional narrative paragraph from the compliance snapshot, written into the section text field like other AI-drafted sections. High priority — good AI use case.

## AI contact importer + interaction-logging scope (LOCKED, July 2026)

**Phase 1 SHIPPED** — text-path AI import built into the Bulk-add contacts grid
(`renderBulkAdd` in `index.html`). A paste box → `_aiParseContacts()` calls
Claude Haiku (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`) with a `json_schema` structured-output
contract → `aiExtractContacts()` populates the grid rows for human review before
Save. `BULK_ROWS` is now dynamic (`let`, cap `BULK_ROWS_MAX = 50`), resets to 10
on `openBulkAdd()`, grows to fit extracted contacts, plus a "+ Add rows" button
(`bulkAddMoreRows`). Helpers: `_bulkAIPanelHTML`, `_bulkSetRow`,
`_bulkRestoreRows`, `_bulkUnlockRow`. Panel carries an explicit PII/API notice;
extract button disabled with a hint when no Claude key is saved. Nothing saves
without review.

**Phase 2 (planned, not built)** — vision path for the SAME desktop grid:
images (screenshots, business-card photos, roster photos) and PDFs via Sonnet 5
(`claude-sonnet-5`), routed by input type. Still lands in the review grid.

**LOCKED SCOPE BOUNDARIES (do not cross without Jeff's explicit say-so):**
1. **Image/scan AI import → CONTACTS ONLY, DESKTOP ONLY.** The Bulk-add review
   grid is the only surface. A contact is just a name — misreads are trivially
   fixable in the grid, and import is additive/low-stakes.
2. **Interactions → MANUAL ENTRY ONLY. No AI scan/extract into interactions,
   ever.** An interaction is a compliance claim (date, who, what, logged-by)
   that can flow into an FHWA/NEPA report; it must be entered deliberately and
   attributed, not guessed from a scan. Rationale asymmetry: contact import =
   onboarding speed (low stakes); interaction logging = compliance integrity
   (the product itself).
3. **Mobile stays a logging tool, NOT an import tool.** Do not add scanners or
   AI importers to `mobile.html`. Field logging in the moment is its job.

**Deferred (decoupled, do NOT entangle with the importer work):** an optional
desktop **quick-log interaction grid** — a rapid multi-row manual entry surface
(date · stakeholder typeahead over the project's existing linked stakeholders ·
channel · summary · logged-by initials) that writes to the same `pi_interactions`
table with the other fields defaulted (`direction`/`subject`/`category` blank,
`sentiment` 'Neutral', `followUp` false). Constrained to stakeholders that
ALREADY exist at the project level — no new-contact creation, no fuzzy matching.
Build only after the contact importer proves itself; keep it a separate, small,
desktop-only feature.

## Competitive positioning (researched June 29, 2026)

**Only direct competitor: PublicInput.com.** Founded by former transportation
planning consultants, used by 12 state DOTs + major MPOs + 200 consulting
firms. Functions as a public-facing engagement CRM (geo-targeted outreach,
multi-channel input collection, meeting/hearing management, analytics).
Enterprise SaaS, agency-wide contracts, likely $20K–$100K+/yr.

**Not direct competitors** (different category/buyer):
- **CivicPlus** — municipal CMS/resident self-service (permits, FOIA, 311), not PI/transportation-specific
- **Granicus** — citizen-facing engagement hubs/dashboards, not an internal PI consultant tool
- **OpenGov** — government finance/budgeting/transparency platform, community feedback is a minor module

**Second-tier competitor: Simply Stakeholders.** Modern AI-equipped stakeholder
RM platform, ~30 years founder experience, real clients (Glencore, NZ Transport
Agency, etc.), cheap entry pricing for small teams. General-purpose — not
transportation/NEPA-specific. Also note the wider field of established
infrastructure stakeholder tools: Tractivity (UK regulated infrastructure),
Borealis (large NA programs), Jambo (entry-level NA logging), EngagementHQ/
Granicus, Syrenis SMART, Citizen Space (UK compliance/consultation). **None of
these — including Simply Stakeholders — are purpose-built for FHWA/NEPA-
regulated U.S. transportation PI.** No NEPA stage tagging, no U.S. Title VI/EJ
compliance fields, no UDOT-specific workflow. That gap is real and is Horizon
COMPASS's defensible niche.

**Core distinction driving all product decisions:** PublicInput is built for
the *agency* to collect public input at scale. Horizon COMPASS is built for
the *PI consultant* (the Sunrise-style firm) to manage stakeholder
relationships, commitments, issues, and FHWA/NEPA compliance documentation
as their actual daily internal workflow. Compliance in PublicInput is a
byproduct of engagement data; in Horizon COMPASS it is the product itself.

**Differentiation priorities (do NOT build toward #1):**
1. Do not compete on public engagement scale — no mass SMS/social campaigns, no survey tooling. PublicInput owns this; not worth contesting.
2. Own the consultant's internal system of record — this is the underserved buyer.
3. Compliance docs (NEPA stage tagging, tribal consultation, LEP/EJ flags, comment periods) should stay daily-use workflow tools, not just report outputs.
4. AI report drafting (`_claudeNarrative()`) is a genuine wedge — no competitor researched offers this.
5. Win on price/speed of adoption vs. PublicInput's agency procurement cycle — sell to the consultant/firm, not the state.

**Strategic framing for any UDOT-facing pitch:** position Horizon COMPASS as
*complementary to* existing PublicInput contracts a DOT may already have,
not a replacement. Full positioning brief: `HC_Competitive_Positioning_Brief.docx`
(not in this repo — held by Jeff).

**Realistic market assessment (why this is winnable, not just defensible):**
1. No researched competitor is purpose-built for FHWA/NEPA-regulated U.S.
   transportation PI — this gap is real and currently unaddressed.
2. The builder is the buyer — every competitor was built by a software
   company selling to PI professionals from the outside; Horizon COMPASS is
   built by a working PI professional living the daily workflow. This shows
   up in design details (report distribution groups, anonymous contact
   logging, bulk import) shaped by real friction, not guesswork.
3. Winnable segment is small-to-mid PI consulting firms (Sunrise and similar
   regional firms doing UDOT/county/municipal work), NOT enterprise agency
   contracts — competitors sell agency-wide enterprise deals with long
   procurement cycles; this product should stay fast-to-adopt for an
   individual firm or PI manager.
4. The win condition is staying laser-focused on the niche, not becoming a
   general-purpose stakeholder platform. Going general-purpose loses against
   better-capitalized, longer-tenured competitors (PublicInput, Simply
   Stakeholders, Tractivity). Staying NEPA/UDOT-specific keeps the moat.

**Open validation step (not yet done):** talk to 3–5 PI managers at other
firms (not just Sunrise) to confirm NEPA/UDOT pain points are shared
industry-wide before investing further in feature build-out. Treat this as
a prerequisite check before large new feature commitments — if a proposed
feature only reflects Sunrise's specific workflow rather than an
industry-wide PI pain point, flag it for Jeff to validate first.

**De-prioritized (keep, but don't deepen further — commodity ground already
served well by competitors):** influence map / stakeholder engagement
matrix visualizations, sentiment tracking / bulk sentiment update,
group/coalition management. Do NOT build mass public engagement tooling
(surveys, SMS blasts, social monitoring, resident-facing input portals) —
that's PublicInput/Granicus/EngagementHQ territory; Horizon COMPASS stays
internal-facing.

## PI Client Portal — BUILT (`client-portal.html`, ~1,120 lines)

**Status: shipped and working.** The strategic bet (the "third leg" no
competitor has — keeping the PI firm's client continuously informed) is live.
`client-portal.html` is a standalone read-only client app.

**Two access paths:**
- **Token link (primary)** — Projects view → "Portal" button → `sharePortalLink()`
  creates a `pi_portal_links` row (UUID token) → URL
  `client-portal.html?token=XXX`. `bootFromToken()` resolves the token to a
  project and renders. No client login. Copy/Revoke wired via
  `_renderPortalBtnActive/Inactive()` on `.portal-btn-container[data-proj][data-style]`.
- **Magic-link login** (`pi_client_access` + Supabase OTP) for multi-project
  clients — the portal side (project selector, `switchProject`, per-project
  data) is fully built. **Phase 1 provisioning admin SHIPPED** (July 2026):
  Settings → **Client Portal Access** grants access **by email** (no pre-invite).
  Migration `sql/2026-07-13_client_access_by_email.sql` adds an `email` column +
  a JWT-email read policy (`lower(email)=lower(auth.jwt()->>'email')`) + an
  anon SELECT policy so the admin UI can list grants. Provisioning is **Option C
  (manual)**: `renderClientAccessPanel()` / `caGenerateGrantSQL()` /
  `caGenerateRevokeSQL()` generate INSERT/DELETE SQL you paste into Supabase —
  the app never writes grants (anon has no insert, so clients can't self-grant).
  `_clientAccessFetch()` reads `pi_client_access` with an explicit anon Bearer.
  **Functional today** (data loads via existing permissive RLS); **not yet
  isolated** — per-table email-scoped RLS + an Edge Function for one-click
  invite are Phase 2/3. `client-portal.html` needs no change (bootApp reads
  grants via RLS).
  - **OTP login prereqs:** portal login uses `create_user:true` (grant-by-email
    self-provisions the auth user on first OTP login); Supabase must have email
    signups enabled + the portal URL in Auth Redirect URLs. Session persists in
    `localStorage` with refresh-token renewal (survives browser close / ~1h
    token expiry); last email is prefilled; a one-time "bookmark this page" tip
    shows after login.
  - **⚠ Configure custom SMTP before onboarding real clients.** Supabase's
    built-in auth email sender is rate-limited (~few/hour + ~60s per-address
    cooldown → "email rate limit exceeded") and has poor deliverability (login
    links land in spam). Set Authentication → Emails → SMTP to a provider
    (Resend / Postmark / SendGrid / SES) before any real client logs in.
    **This is a Supabase-dashboard setting only — no app code changes and
    nothing to remove once configured; delete this reminder line when done.**
  - **`SUPPORT_CONTACT`** in `client-portal.html` sets the client-facing email
    shown on the "no access yet" screen (`_noAccessHTML`) — update it from the
    default before onboarding.

**Portal sections (NAV):** Overview (stats + "Needs Attention" panel),
Deliverables, Engagement (date-ranged), Issues, Commitments, Comment Periods,
and the AI Summary tab. Field curation is done per-fetch (only client-safe
columns queried).

**Security note (unchanged / known):** token isolation is client-side; the
anon key is public and RLS is permissive (blanket anon read on portal tables).
Server-side token-scoped RLS is the separate hardening project (ties to
multi-tenant org_id work). Reminder learned the hard way: new portal tables
need an explicit `grant ... to anon;` — RLS policies alone give "permission
denied for table" (see sql/2026-07-06_client_summaries_grant_fix.sql).

## IN PROGRESS — Client reporting redesign (locked plan, July 2026)

**Problem being fixed:** the standalone **Client Summary tab** (in Reports)
regenerated "recent" + "full" AI narratives from raw project data — a second
pipeline parallel to the PI Report Editor, redundant with the reports the
consultant already emails clients, and redundant with the Report Archive's
"AI: Summarize PI trend". Confusing for consultant and client.

**New model (simpler):** the portal's summary area = (1) ONE current curated
**trend narrative** (consultant edits before publish) + (2) a list of **shared
PI reports** (consultant toggles which archived reports are client-visible),
rendered in-portal + downloadable. No section suppression — full transparency
(sentiment matrix, interaction notes all OK per Jeff). Kill the Client Summary
tab and its raw-data regeneration entirely.

**Locked decisions:** (1) reports both render in-portal AND download; (2) no
section-level curation — everything a report contains is client-safe; (3)
single current trend, prior ones kept as history.

**Data model:**
- `pi_report_archive` → add `client_visible boolean default false`; portal reads
  rows where true. (Remember the GRANT.)
- `pi_client_summaries` → repurposed with NO schema change: trend text in
  `content_full`, `content_recent` unused, latest `published_at` = current
  trend, older rows = history.

**Build order (ALL CODE SHIPPED — migration still needs running):**
1. ✅ Migration: `sql/2026-07-06_portal_shared_reports.sql` — add `client_visible`
   + idempotent grants. **Jeff must run this in Supabase** or the Share toggle
   errors and the portal can't read shared reports.
2. ✅ COMPASS Report Archive: "Share with client" toggle per archived report
   (`toggleReportShared()` flips `client_visible`); trend button → generate →
   editable textarea → "Publish trend to client portal" (`publishClientTrend()`,
   keeps human gate). Client-portal status line in archive header.
3. ✅ Removed Client Summary tab + `generateClientSummaryDraft()` +
   `publishClientSummary()`. Stale `S.rptTab==='client-summary'` normalized to
   'reports'.
4. ✅ Portal (`client-portal.html`): "AI Summary" nav → "Project Updates";
   both boots fetch `pi_report_archive?client_visible=eq.true` into
   `_sharedReports`; `renderSummary()` → current trend (`content_full`) + trend
   history + shared-reports list. `renderArchivedReportHTML()` renders sections
   read-only (mirrors desktop `_buildArchivedPreviewHTML`); `printSharedReport()`
   opens a clean print window = v1 "download" (true .docx deferred).
5. ⬜ End-to-end test (after migration is run): share a report, publish a trend,
   open portal link, confirm both render.

**Cross-app:** reports module is desktop-only — mobile/importer unaffected.

## Supabase project
- URL: `https://ncfbblhlsiglxkoiounv.supabase.co`
- Anon key in `index.html` line ~505 (`SUPA_KEY`)
- Tables use Row Level Security (anon key has read/write via policy)
